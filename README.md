The goal for this The Odin Project is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

The form asks for the name, email and phone of the user. 
It also requests a password that needs to be confirmed and that needs to adhere to common requirements.

This project required the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is important to validate data input via forms on the server-side. However, there are advantages to also validating on the client-side.

In order to complete this project it was important to understand forms and their components. HTML and JavaScript provide us with useful tools that help us validate forms on the client side.

The website hosting the form was published via Github and can be accessed using the following link:
